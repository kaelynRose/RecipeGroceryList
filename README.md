# RecipeGroceryList
Class project utilizing PHP and MySQL to log recipes and use them to create a grocery list

# Objective
## Problem: We have a lot of recipes in my household and I wanted some way to search and filter these recipes. I also wanted a way to get a list of the ingredients for any recipes that I wanted to make during a given week. This list I could then take grocery shopping.
## Solution: Developing a relational database to hold recipe information along with user information so multiple people could potentially use this and have their own grocery lists. Recipes are shared across all users however.

# Languages Utilized
